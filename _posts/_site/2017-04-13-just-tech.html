<p>Yesterday I was writing about my coding preconceptions - today I intend to write about my reconceptions! Although having said that, today in class I’ve been having my consciousness expanded with the introduction of Testing Driven Development!</p>

<p>I should probably stick to my guns and write about what I intended, but I’m mindful that the pace of this course is going to be such that I’ll be caught in a Tristram Shandian predicament</p>

<p>DRY</p>

<p>Code best practice</p>

<p>Make variables descriptive. Code is written once, but read many times.</p>

<p>Brevity is not necessarily good.</p>

<p>TDD helps you get into flow state</p>
