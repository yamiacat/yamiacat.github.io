<p>The last couple of days I have been trying to come to terms with the fact that I have a LOT of useless preconceptions about coding.</p>

<p>One of the first is that <strong>less is more</strong>. The shorter the code, the more elegant it is, right? I’ve definitely heard people talk about elegant code. It’s a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>Now, I know that Hollywood takes this idea to ridiculous extremes. In movies, with just a few keystrokes (probably made while having a gun held to your head, or in free fall, or inside an alien mothership that inexplicably runs OSX) you can accomplish almost anything!</p>

<p>I’m not expecting to reach Christopher-Lambert-in-<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106950/">Fortress</a> levels of code brevity. But I was under the distinct impression that the fewer lines of code you wrote to accomplish a given goal, the better that code was.</p>

<p>Another preconception is <strong>the power of the arcane!</strong> Code looks completely opaque to the uninitiated… it’s basically magick*, and there’s a part of me that wants to write condensed code with abbreviated variables and occult method names. After all, <em>I</em> know what it means - I can save myself a few dozen keystrokes if I shorten everything down, and if my code is cryptic enough, I may be mistaken for a wizard!</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m splitting this post in two as I’m pretty wiped out from a long day at the course, followed by a trip to the cinema to see an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9nette">extraordinary documentary</a> about the human condition, told exclusively through close ups of orang-utans’ faces. I’ll get to my reconceptions tomorrow!</p>

<p>* In a broader sense I believe that technology actually <strong>is</strong> magick, mind. So far this year I’ve used a <em>scrying glass</em> (webcam), <em>seven league boots</em> (train, uber), <em>magic mirror</em> (google), <em>flying carpet</em> (airplane), <em>telepathy spell</em> (mobile phones), <em>conjuration</em> (amazon now) and goodness knows what else! We’re all living the lives of wizards!</p>
