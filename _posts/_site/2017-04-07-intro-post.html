<p>Right, so, welcome to the very beginning of my blog, reader!</p>

<p>I am just wrapping up the third week of pre-course work for CodeClan’s 16 week Diploma in Software Development, which I’ll be undertaking in Edinburgh. Monday 10 April marks the beginning of week 1, so I guess that makes this week 0, and starting to count from zero is apparently one of the little cognitive tweaks I need to make, so let’s start now.</p>

<p>As part of this pre-course work, I’ve been working through some of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy’s</a> basic tracks, learning how to use the command line, git, ruby, and basic html and css. One of the activities, labelled “Deploy a Website”, actually turned out to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to auto-generate this site!? I had been kind of planning to create something from scratch to practice the basics, but fine, let’s stick with this for now…</p>
