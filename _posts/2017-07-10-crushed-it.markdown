Wow, week 14 of CodeClan.

Kinda gave up on the blogging at week 5 as the course intensity really picked up. So how've I been doing? Pretty good. Crushed it weeks 6 and 7. There was a medical situation preventing me from crushing it to my usual standards in week 8, so I had to take some time off until I was able to crush it at 100%, at which point I resumed crushing it full-time.

I've covered Java (LOVE that static strong typing) and vanilla JavaScript in that time. Having a hard time growing to love JavaScript, but I'm gradually coming around, I suppose.

Also, I've updated my CV. Shiz' about to get *real*.
