Last week we were introduced to <b>T</b>esting <b>D</b>riven <b>D</b>evelopment, or TDD, and I have to say - I have found it **revelatory**.

It's a term I've heard before, although I've never really understood it. I'm aware that software testing is a big part of making a functional product. Beta tests - when a product is pre-launched *caveat utilitor* to tech-confident users who expect to encounter bugs, and help the software developers track them down for fixing, are perhaps the most well known kind of tests among the the general public.
