Yesterday I was writing about my coding preconceptions - today I intend to write about my reconceptions! Although having said that, today in class I've been having my consciousness expanded with the introduction of Testing Driven Development!

I should probably stick to my guns and write about what I intended to write about. Although right now, of course, I'm writing about dithering about deciding what to write. Given the rapid pace with which the course introduces new topics, I'm likely to fall behind, finding myself in the Tristram-Shandian predicament of writing at breakneck pace but making little headway into the narrative! I mean, I've still barely posted about any of the week 0 things I've bookmarked for myself!

(This book is fantastic, by the way - if you haven't read it already and you're only going to read one 18th century novel this year, read this one! Also, ask me about story time vs discourse time if you're feeling generous and want me to get some use out of my English Literature degree!)

DRY


Code best practice

Make variables descriptive. Code is written once, but read many times.

Brevity is not necessarily good.


TDD helps you get into flow state
