DRY


Code best practice

Make variables descriptive. Code is written once, but read many times.

Brevity is not necessarily good.

\* Technology *totally* is magick, though. So far this year I've used a *scrying glass* (webcam), *seven league boots* (train, uber), *oracle* (google), *flying carpet* (airplane), *telepathy spell* (mobile phones), *conjuration* (amazon now) and goodness knows what else! We're all living the lives of wizards!
