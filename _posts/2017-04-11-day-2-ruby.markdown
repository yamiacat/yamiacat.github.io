Day 2 completed! I bashed out the beginning of this blogpost at lunchtime, intending to come back to it in the evening and flesh it out.

As it stands, I had quite a buzz from tackling the homework straight away, including the extension activities, but then I traipsed around Edinburgh buying laundry materials and other knick-knacks, and now I'm shattered.

We were reviewing Ruby conditional operators and control flow, which I was pleasingly familiar with from the pre-course Codecademy.

...and I experiemented, successfully, with embedding GitHub gists into Jekyll posts:

Behold - a gist!

*/
(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
s.src = 'https://futuremorlock.disqus.com/embed.js';
s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
(d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
})();
