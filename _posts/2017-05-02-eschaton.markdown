Ok, so it's been over a week since my last blogpost. This is a testament to the ass-kickingly intense course load. I'm keeping up with the homework and managing to tackle all of the extension activities, but it's not leaving me with much motivation to look at a screen after my commitments have been met!

Last week we learned some SQL and how to integrate it into Ruby.

This week we're using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html) to get Ruby to talk to a webpage. Thursday this week we'll be given our first full project - produce a full on web app. Exciting!

Anyway, yesterday's homework was to make a basic game of rock paper scissors, and the extension was to pretty it up somehow.

I, uh... I did this. Those are animated gifs of atom bomb explosions, obviously....

[Infinite Jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest) provided some inspiration...

With a [WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames) reference....
