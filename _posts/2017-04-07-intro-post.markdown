Right, so, welcome to the very beginning of my blog, reader!

I am just wrapping up the third week of pre-course work for CodeClan's 16 week Diploma in Software Development, which I'll be undertaking in Edinburgh. Monday 10 April marks the beginning of week 1, so I guess that makes this week 0, and starting to count from zero is apparently one of the little cognitive tweaks I need to make, so let's start now.

As part of this pre-course work, I've been working through some of [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com) basic tracks, learning how to use the command line, git, ruby, and basic html and css. One of the activities, labelled "Deploy a Website", actually turned out to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to auto-generate this site!? I had been kind of planning to create something from scratch to practice the basics, but fine, let's stick with this for now...
