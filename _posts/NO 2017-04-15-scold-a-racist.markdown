I spent Saturday morning completing my homework. Well, not completing - everything works, but I should probably go refactor it and make it as slick as my current abilities allow. It's an exercise making functions for a pretend pet shop, and in theory I should have been using TDD - I'm not sure yet how successfully I managed that. Felt like I was rushing ahead a bunch of the time, when I should have been taking smaller incremental steps. I only mention this because my dear friend Jon made quite the bon mot about it that I'd like to share:

Anyway - whereas I could have spent Saturday evening refactoring or studying or, I don't know, socialising or getting some fresh air, I instead spent it listening to [Ulver](http://www.jester-records.com/ulver/ulver.html) and schooling some racist friend-of-a-friend on Facebook.

Since I'd quite enjoyed myself and typed out a massive wall of text, I thought I may as well repurpose it as a blogpost and inflict it on you good people.  

For context, my friend had posted a video celebrating the fact that Colorado made access to birth control easier, and as a result, saw a big drop in teen abortions. (Q: Why would this utterly common-sensical idea need promoting? A: America!) His racist friend decides to comment that, looking at the issue from a planetary perspective, if "us" doesn't multiply as fast as "them", then **direct quote** "this is how civilisations disapear." They also had some muddled thinking about everything being "eugenics" and populations "sending" people to developed countries as some sort of breeding fifth columm.

Anyway, my proposed solution to a scenario in which developed nation Population A is being migrated to by an undeveloped nation's Population B

could increase population B's living standards, at which point they jump on the birth-control-have-less-children bandwagon with a vengeance. Anywhere where women aren't treated like shit that has a half way decent level of development sees birth rates plunge as infant mortality declines and people realise they don't actually need to birth a bunch of back ups. Thinking the the solution to our planets problems is to get developed nations to match birthrates with undeveloped nations is eye-swivellingly stupid.

You're using the word eugenics exactly wrong. Everything is natural selection (natural as in physical law). Eugenics is an attempt to structure that, and in fact is an example of magical thinking, pretty much.

Also, when populations mix, it takes generations to fully blend. Sure, the people that come over on boats or whatever will barely integrate. Their kids will sound like locals, but still have a lot of their parents heritage. Their grandkids will be culturally indistinguishable from yours, and in all likelihood won't even speak the language of their grandparents homeland. That's the way it's always been, and I don't know why anyone would think any different.

Eugenics is the crackpot 'science' (it's really not a science) of hubristic humans thinking they have ANY kind of handle on what constitutes 'fit' in the whole survival of the fittest game. When we discovered genes, we thought we had the rules of the game down, and starting culling people (or their bloodlines) accordingly. The choice of who got neutered was pretty much entirely ideologically based (funny how it was the darker skin toned folks up for the snip more than whitey, eh?). For example, there was a lot of talk of making IQ tests a determining factor in who got to breed. IQ tests are basically voodoo and, coincidentally, systemically favour middle class whitey.

You're using the word 'natural' as if it means nature in the forests and jungles and places where there are no humans sense. That is not at all the sense in which it is meant. Darwin et al were talking about 'natural law', which is the phrase they used to mean the laws of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and so on down the line. Everything that can physically happen in this reality is natural, in that sense.

So yeah, my tribe and your tribe live in caves and bash each other up with tapir jaw bones and have a horrifically high infant mortality rate - that's natural. My tribe invents medicine, computers, and firearms and wipes your tribe out, while allowing our sickly and disabled to thrive - that's natural too.

We have almost no idea about how genes actually translate into lifeforms. We can map genomes, which is like being able to count how many words are on a blueprint, but we are currently unable to figure out the proteome, which is how those genes make proteins and how those proteins are actually expressed - in other words, we can't really read any of the numbers on the blueprint, or read the diagram - a pretty fucking big problem if we're trying to decide what's needed and what's not come construction time. And then there's the fact that the genome is only part of the picture. Epigenetics allows non permanent changes to be passed down for multiple generations without showing up in the gattaca stuff. There are quite possibly other similar mechanics in play that we are totally ignorant of...

...and then there's the fact that our genome is only, I dunno, 10% of the genetic matter that we're made up of? For every cell in your body you're carrying around hundreds or thousands or, shit, millions of single cell life forms that live in and on us and pretty much no-where else. We feel like an individual, but we're actually a rainforest, or better, a city in our own right. We currently have only the haziest notions of how our microbiome influences us and makes us who we are.

Now, let's talk about how selection applies at ALL levels. On the microscopic level, if your metabolism or basic biochemistry isn't as fit as the next guys, you die off. If your gut flora and fauna aren't as fit as the next guys - you die off. On the level that we usually live on and think about, if your gross physical form isn't as fit as the next guys, you die off. Note - this is the only factor most people are talking about when they say survival of the fittest. More subtly, if your neuro-structure or neuro-chemistry aren't as fit as the next guy, you die off. If your neural and hormonal systems interact with the culture you're born into in a less fit way than the next guy, you die off. But here's the kicker - ideas and belief systems are under selective pressure, and contribute to selective fitness as well, so if you've got less fit beliefs than the next guy, you die off, or if any of the previous criteria effect how you interact with your societies beliefs in a less fit way, you die off. And now we can start to look at group dynamics, because it's not just you being selected, it's your family - so if any of these factors impact the fitness of your family in a less fit way than the next family, your family dies off. And that pressure applies to the tribal level, to the point where humans that have managed to expand tribes to nation state size have pretty much wiped out the smaller tribes. And the selection doesn't end there - the nations most fit will outlast the less fit. They will be judged by all of the above criteria at once, and a whole bunch more. The universe is fucking great at multitasking that way.

I've tried, in all of that, to use the word 'fit' rather than 'strong', and it's important to recognise that fitness consists ENTIRELY and SOLELY of the ability to produce another generation that carries on after you. People get hung up on the word 'strong' - it's not meant literally. The strongest survive because that's how strong is defined. You're right that the future belongs to the kids of those that have kids, but you seem to think that having more kids is automatically better. This is not at all the case. Organisms employ a variety of reproductive strategies. I think they're called P and K strategies. Basically, some organisms have a shitload of kids, but consequently don't have the resources to do anything for them. Think turtles. Other organisms favour having just a few kids, and spending intensive time and effort making sure those kids survive. Humanity is very clearly at that end of the spectrum. Our babies are the weakest, least fit infants in any part of the animal kingdom. They're fucking useless, for a really long time. But they grow up to be the most intelligent, adaptable, dangerous organism on the planet, because we invest such a lot of time in them. You seem to have missed the part about development automatically lowering birth rates. I recommend you do some googling about birth rates and development. (Well, about all of this stuff) If another culture has high birth rates that you find alarming, the answer is to develop their economies and empower their women and their birthrates will drop in line with ours.

Big picture, our fitness is going to be determined by our ability to stay 'fit' regardless of what's coming. Climate change, ecosystem destruction and resource depletion are going to be challenging as fuck, and even if someone didn't believe in those things, they'd still have to acknowledge that the Earth could get beaned by a fast-moving rock at any time, or a supervolcano could darken the skies, and everything could go to shit. The internet tells me that it was Martin Luther King that said "We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools." - I'm not a 100% confident in the attribution, because the internet often lies about that kind of stuff, but whoever said it has a really good point. If we factionalise and fight we're most likely fucked. If we co-operate and reciprocate then, who knows, we might stand a chance.
